#OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

So to complete the task at hand I used cv2 model in python.

###Task4.1:
We can create different types of images from normal math function of using the functions available in cv2. like cv2.circle(), cv2.rectangle, etc
We can change the thickness of the object or the colour to change up the image.
Here i created a pattern on small black image. Making the pattern takes time as the no of picxel increases so you can make the pattern on small image then enlarge it to see it clearly. This is saved as demo.png

Then we can make a pattern with gifferent size of circles. This is saved as demo1.png

We can also make a gradient pattern, experimenting with different colors. Thses are saved as demo2.png and demo3.png

###Task4.2:
1. Capture a image. Detect a face using the cascade Classifier function of cv2. Load the haarcascade_frontface_default.xml to train the model to detect face. after the face is detected, draw a rectangle around it and crop that part of the image. save this image in crop.png
2. Load 2 previously generated pictures and sway a part of both. These are saved in swap.png and swap1.png

###Task4.3:
We can combine previously generated images horizontally and vertically using vstack[] anf hstack[] function of numpy.

The Task was sucessfully completed!!
