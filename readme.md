# OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

I completed the task using cv2 model in python.

## Task4.1:
```We can create different types of images from normal math function or by using the functions available in cv2. 
like cv2.circle(), cv2.rectangle, etc.
We can change and use different combinations of the thickness or the colour to change up the image.
Here i created a pattern on small black image. As no of pixel increases, making the pattern takes time. 
So you can make the pattern on a small image and then enlarge it to see clearly. View and save the image created.
```

```Then we can make a pattern with different size of circles, using circles function of cv2. ```

```We can also make a gradient pattern, using line function. 
Experimenting with different colors and thickness can create different images. Like-

## Task4.2:
```
1. Capture a image,detect a face using the cascade Classifier function of cv2 
  (Load the haarcascade_frontface_default.xml to train the model to detect face).
  After the face is detected, draw a rectangle around it and crop that part of the image.
  Display and save the image.

```
2. Load previously generated pictures and swap a part of both. 
Different images that can be create-

## Task4.3:
```We can combine previously generated images horizontally and vertically using vstack([]) and hstack([]) function of numpy.```
